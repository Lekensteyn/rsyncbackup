# .backup-config - example configuration for syncing folders to a(n encrypted)

# These UUIDs can be found by looking in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ once the device is
# unlocked ("decrypted") and mounted:

#   e33dd512-9d4e-4852-9fa0-bd0e7689455d -> ../../dm-1 <-- unlocked device
#
# or by executing "sudo blkid":
#   /dev/sdb1: UUID="a0becda8-1af5-4767-9df0-c5a21508eaff" TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
